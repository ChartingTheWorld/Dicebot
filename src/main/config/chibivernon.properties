LessThanOneGroup: Rolling fewer than 1 groups may cause pan-dimensional collapse and a great deal of wibbly. Let's not do it.
Roll0Dice: It's come to my attention you're rolling 0 dice. I'm pleased to inform you that you've rolled NaN. Good day.
Roll0Sides: My god, man, you've rolled a die with no sides! We have to act quickly! You stay put and hold this umbrella, I'll go get the lemurs.
OneSidedDice: Well, you rolled %DICECOUNT% one-sided dice, so you get a %DICECOUNT%. Also, I've been authorized to begin unethical testing with your corpse. Stand by...
KeepingLessThan1: Keeping fewer than 1 dice isn't Zen, Dragon-san, it's madness. MADNESS, I TELL YOU!
RollLessThanKeep: Rolling fewer dice than you're keeping? This is the perfect time to try out my new anti-cheating Bushido Bot!
BadCommand: Somehow, in the milliseconds between asking me to do something and now, I've forgotten how to do the thing you asked! I've even forgotten what it was!
CannotSatisfyRerollSingleDie: It seems that the reroll condition %REROLL% can't be met by a die with %SIDES% sides. I suggest a rousing game of Candyland instead.
CannotSatisfyRerollMultipleDice: It seems that the reroll condition %REROLL% can't be met by %DICEROLLED% dice with %SIDES% sides. I suggest a rousing game of Candyland instead.
InfiniteExplosion: Make a reservation at Milliways, since the infinitely exploding dice on that roll won't be done until the end of the universe.
BrokenRegexp: What's that? You've somehow broken regexps? Oh dear. I think you need to spend some time in the Alone Room.
ParseBadShort: Hm. I could handle %BADSHORT% as a value but it would require a fundamental reordering of the universe. Hang on just an eon...
ReflectionError: The fundamental constants of the universe seem a little off-kilter today. Better not try that again.
CannotSatisfySuccesses: I may be clinically insane, but even I know you'll never get %SUCCESSESNEEDED% successes off %DICEROLLED% dice.
Cheat: Cheating's limited to the Europa Team only, sorry.
DCEquals0: Your DC can't be 0, I'm afraid, unless you just happen to be visiting from outside this universe.
Leave: You'll be hearing from the post-experiment survey team in a few days. Hope you don't need those teeth! 
LeaveIdleChannel: Oooh, what does THIS button do?
StatusGeneral: Copacetic, one supposes.
StatusChannelCount: I'm observing experiments in %CHANNELCOUNT% channels!
StatusRolledCount: I've rolled %GROUPSROLLED% groups and %DICEROLLED% actual dice since being turned on.
JoinChannelDenied: Love to, but I'm at my max number of channels and I can't leave any.
DrawNonNumberCards: The number of cards has to be a number! That's why it's a number!
DrawCard: draws %CARDCOUNT% cards for %NICK%. It's a secret to everyone.
DrawCardAndNotify: draws %CARDCOUNT% cards for %NICK% and notifies %NOTIFYNICK%.

CriticalFailures:Excellent! We've been looking for a test subject. Hold on to this horseshoe and penny while I alert the Leprechaun Entrapment Brigade, we'll have you fixed in no time...#We've developed an implantable luck generator you could try, if you aren't using that liver...
CriticalSuccesses:Ah, then this IS the reality where you're kicking ass. My apologies, I'll amend my notes.#Astonishing! May I borrow your pituitary gland for a moment? You'll get it back good as new, I promise!
